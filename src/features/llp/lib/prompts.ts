  return `You are an expert Aadhaar card OCR system. ONE Aadhaar card image is provided.
Your task: extract EVERY detail from this card with 100% accuracy.

FIELDS TO EXTRACT:

1. "fullName" — The cardholder's name, printed prominently on the FRONT.
   Copy EXACTLY as printed, character by character. Check spelling twice.

2. "salutation" — Infer from gender printed on card (Male/पुरुष → "Mr.", Female/महिला → "Mrs." or "Ms.")

3. "relationDescriptor" — One of: "S/O", "D/O", "W/O", "C/O"
   Look for these markers on the card. They may appear:
   - On the FRONT below the name
   - On the BACK above or within the address
   - In various capitalizations: "S/O", "s/o", "S/o", "C/O", "c/o" etc.
   - With or without a colon: "S/O:" or "S/O"

4. "fatherSalutation" — "Mr." if S/O or C/O, "Mrs." if D/O or W/O (for mother/spouse)

5. "fatherName" — The name that appears AFTER the relation descriptor (S/O, D/O, W/O, C/O).
   - Strip any title prefix: remove "Mr.", "Mrs.", "Shri", "Smt.", "Late" etc.
   - Copy the remaining name EXACTLY as printed.
   - This MUST NOT be the same as "fullName". If they look identical, re-read the card.
   - If the card image does not show the relation descriptor area (e.g., only front side uploaded and S/O is on back), set to "".

6. "dob" — Date of Birth or Year of Birth, found on the FRONT.
   Labeled as "DOB", "Date of Birth", "Year of Birth", "जन्म तिथि".
   Copy EXACTLY as printed: "15/06/1997" or "1997". Do NOT reformat.

7. "aadhaarAddress" — The full address, usually on the BACK.
   Copy the ENTIRE address as one string, exactly as printed.
   If no address is visible (front-only image), set to "".

RULES:
- Extract ALL 7 fields. Do not skip any.
- If a field is genuinely not visible in the image (e.g., back side not shown), return "".
- Do NOT guess or hallucinate. Only return what is clearly printed on the card.
- Do NOT confuse similar-looking names. Read carefully.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with exactly these 7 keys:
{"fullName":"...","salutation":"...","relationDescriptor":"...","fatherSalutation":"...","fatherName":"...","dob":"...","aadhaarAddress":"..."}

No markdown, no code fences, no explanation — just the JSON object.`;

- "guardian", "C/O", "c/o" → relationDescriptor = "C/O", fatherSalutation = "Mr."
